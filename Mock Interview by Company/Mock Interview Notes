Better Masterization of the Java Syntax

Test on test cases before jumping into code

Vocalize your algorithms better before jumping into code

Ask better clarifying questions

	- null pointer?
	- duplicates?
	- memory restrction? Disk or Ram?
	- thread restriction?
	- where is this stored?

Master Binary Search by understanding the finish case
	- getting there by modifying three lines of code


Learn how to implement all the sorts by hand

Things to study for: 

	- Bitwise Operation in algorithms

	- Trees

	- DFS/BFS

	- Graph Traversal

	- Sorts(Review their implementation)

Crucial to learn all of the cost of operation for each data structure
